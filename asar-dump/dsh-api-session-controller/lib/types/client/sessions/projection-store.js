 * the Host generation loses, so a replayed frame cannot regress a value and a
 * stale baseline cannot overwrite a newer frame. Cached writes (the session
 * list's zero-I/O block) only fill keys no sequenced row holds, and a baseline
 * discards every cached row before it seeds, regardless of seq: the connected
 * Session is the truth and a cached value never outranks it. A key the store
 * has never seen reads `undefined` (capability absent). Faces are identity-stable
 * per key (create-on-demand, cached) so the React side binds each exactly
 * once; the store-level channel (`subscribeAny`) serves coarse consumers (the
 * manager's list projection reads the `title` key).
