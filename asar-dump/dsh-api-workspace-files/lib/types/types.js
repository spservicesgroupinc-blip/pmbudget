/**
 * Wire types of the `workspaceFiles` Remote namespace. Types only: generated
 * Remote clients consume this module without Host runtime code.
 *
 * Two path vocabularies leave here, and each method uses exactly one:
 *
 * - `read`, `readBytes`, `stat`, and `changes` name a file by its absolute path in the
 *   filesystem's execution world, because their consumer is the Client
 *   resource system, whose `dsh-resource://file/session/<id>/<path>` address carries that
 *   same path.
 * - `list` speaks workspace paths — the same syntax its `path` argument accepts —
 *   because its consumer is a tree rooted at the workspace root.
 *
 * @module @deepseek-ai/dsh-api-workspace-files/types
