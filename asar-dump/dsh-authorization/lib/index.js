/**
* Service Definition for the authorization capability seam (`ctx.authorization`):
* obtaining a credential nobody can supply from configuration alone, because
* getting it requires a conversation with the human — open this page, paste
* that code, pick an account.
*
* The seam owns the conversation and the lifecycle; it never owns the protocol.
* A plugin that knows how to obtain its own credential registers a flow keyed
* by the `CredentialKey` that flow writes, and the flow talks to whatever
* surface started it through one neutral vocabulary of notices and prompts. So
* a second authorization protocol arrives as another flow rather than as
* another seam, and a surface that renders one flow renders all of them.
*
* ```ts
* const dispose = ctx.authorization.registerFlow({
*   key: credentialKey('llm-pi-ai', 'openai-codex'),
*   label: 'ChatGPT (Codex)',
*   methods: [{ id: 'oauth', label: 'Sign in with ChatGPT' }],
*   async run(session) {
*     session.notify({ message: 'Continue in your browser', url })
*     await commitThroughCredentials(await exchange(session.signal))
*   },
* })
* ```
