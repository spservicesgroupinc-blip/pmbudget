/**
 * Service Definition for the authorization capability seam (`ctx.authorization`):
 * obtaining a credential nobody can supply from configuration alone, because
 * getting it requires a conversation with the human — open this page, paste
 * that code, pick an account.
 *
 * The seam owns the conversation and the lifecycle; it never owns the protocol.
 * A plugin that knows how to obtain its own credential registers a flow keyed
 * by the `CredentialKey` that flow writes, and the flow talks to whatever
 * surface started it through one neutral vocabulary of notices and prompts. So
 * a second authorization protocol arrives as another flow rather than as
 * another seam, and a surface that renders one flow renders all of them.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const dispose = ctx.authorization.registerFlow({
 *   key: credentialKey('llm-pi-ai', 'openai-codex'),
 *   label: 'ChatGPT (Codex)',
 *   methods: [{ id: 'oauth', label: 'Sign in with ChatGPT' }],
 *   async run(session) {
 *     session.notify({ message: 'Continue in your browser', url })
 *     await commitThroughCredentials(await exchange(session.signal))
 *   },
 * })
 * ```
