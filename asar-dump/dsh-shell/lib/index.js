* absent both means a clean exit 0.

* shows the exit status as its own pill: leaving the marker in the output
* would render the exit twice. Other markers (timeout, sandbox denial) carry
* facts no pill shows, so they stay in the body.
*
* Replay only retains the rendered content text, not the original

* Requiring a leading newline and the end of the string keeps ordinary output
* that merely ends with marker-like text from matching unless the final line
* is indistinguishable from a real marker.

*
* {@link execute} resolves with the process handle after preparation. "Foreground" is a property of what the caller awaits, not
* of the spawn — a caller that awaits {@link ShellExecution.result} ran the
* command in the foreground; one that keeps the handle ran it in the
* background. A caller that waits only for a while runs the command under
* `onExpiry: 'none'` and bounds its own wait; the handle stays valid after
* the caller stops waiting.
*
* Implementations must honor these semantics:
* - {@link ShellExecution.result} rejects only for infrastructure failures.
*   Nonzero exits, timeout kills, and abort kills resolve with a descriptive
*   result: first-cause `timedOut`/`aborted`, the spec's `timeoutMs` echoed.
* - The handle is published after preparation. `done` settles at process close
*   and never rejects; spawn failures settle as `killed` with the error on the read
*   path, while `result()` carries the same failure as its rejection.
* - `onExpiry: 'none'` arms no deadline; `'kill'` kills at expiry. Expiry
*   during preparation returns a settled timed-out handle without output.
* - {@link ShellProcess.readOutput} is incremental: consecutive reads never
*   repeat output. Lossy reads report truncation and available spill files.
* - A still-running process is stopped and awaited when its owning
*   composition tears down. With the subprocess seam that boundary is
*   `ctx.subprocess` disposal, so a process survives an executor-only reload.
