In both confined modes, programs cannot open named pipes, so a command that captures another program's output through piped stdio (Node.js `child_process.spawn`/`exec` with the default `stdio: 'pipe'`) fails with EPERM, while `stdio: 'inherit'` and `stdio: 'ignore'` spawns work and PowerShell's own pipelines are unaffected.
